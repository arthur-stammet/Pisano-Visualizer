# Pisano-Visualizer
Welcome to a visual journey through the fascinating world of Pisano periods. This gallery presents the Pisano Series for moduli 3 through 520, each rendered as a unique graphical composition. Every series is periodic and ends with a Max-1-0 triplet. The images reveal the rhythmic structures hidden in modular Fibonacci sequences.
